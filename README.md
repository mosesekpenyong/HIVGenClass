HIV-Genome-Classification files description

boundary_overlap_detect.py: This Python script provides functionality to mark points with ellipses on a plot and read input data from an Excel file.
smote_cv_borderline_balanced_binary_class.py: This Python script mounts Google Drive, loads a dataset from an Excel file, preprocesses it by dropping the target column, initializes StratifiedKFold for nested resampling, applies Borderline-SMOTE and SMOTE resampling techniques within each fold of cross-validation, encodes string columns, and saves the results to an Excel file.
smote_cv_borderline_balanced_multi_class.py: This Python script mounts Google Drive, loads a dataset from an Excel file, preprocesses it by dropping the target column, calculates the maximum class count, initializes StratifiedKFold for nested resampling, applies Borderline-SMOTE and SMOTE resampling techniques within each fold of cross-validation with a specific sampling strategy based on class counts, encodes string columns, and saves the results to an Excel file.
SOM.py: This Python script imports necessary libraries, loads data from a CSV file, normalizes the data using MinMaxScaler, creates a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with specified parameters, initializes weights, trains the SOM using random training, obtains clustered labels, and plots the clusters using a colormap based on the number of data points in each cluster.
SVM_Train_Test_binary_class.py: This Python script imports necessary libraries, mounts Google Drive, loads data from an Excel file, preprocesses the dataset by splitting it into train and test sets, defines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, defines evaluation metrics, performs GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the SVM model, evaluates the model on test data, and displays the results including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score for both train and test sets, along with the training and testing time.
SVM_Train_Test_multi_class.py: This Python script imports necessary libraries, mounts Google Drive, loads data from an Excel file, preprocesses the dataset by splitting it into train and test sets, defines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, defines evaluation metrics, performs GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the SVM model, evaluates the model on test data, and displays the results including micro-precision, micro-recall, micro-F1 score, accuracy, and ROC-AUC score for both train and test sets, along with the training and testing time.
